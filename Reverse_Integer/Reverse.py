"""
Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the
signed 32-bit integer range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], then return 0.
Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).
Example 1:
Input: x = 123
Output: 321
Example 2:
Input: x = -123
Output: -321
